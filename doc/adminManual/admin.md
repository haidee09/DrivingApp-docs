## DrivingApp System Administration

This Guide provides information about how to administer the DrivingApp application system. The following describes the administration applications that can be used with DrivingApp, in addition to the administration of the application databases.

### ViVA

ViVA is a Video Surveillance application that aims to support the security guard to prevent situations of risk and consequently improve the quality of life of the people who live in the monitored area. The ViVA application focuses on detecting and analyzing risk situations, such as: theft, access control, people detection, fights, crowd analysis, etc., through the combination of video cameras and sensors, both indoors and outdoors scenarios. For example, parking lots and buildings. You can check the documentation of ViVA at the following [link](https://video-surveillance-application.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

ViVA includes modules for data management of zones, parking lots and streets; these modules are necessary for the DrivingApp application to work properly. In addition, ViVA has a module to consult the location of the users of DrivingApp that are, or who were within any of the registered zones. You can access the ViVA web application in this [link](https://viva-smartsdk.duckdns.org/).

### DrivingApp Administration Application

In order to offer a lightweight tool that includes area management modules and user location consultation, a simple administration application for DrivingApp was developed using the Web2py framework. This administration application contains the modules that ViVA includes to manipulate the information of zones, parking lots and streets, as well as to consult the location of the users of DrivingApp. The source code of this application is on this [repository](https://github.com/smartsdkCenidet/SimpleAdmin).

#### Configuration

The configuration of the application must be updated by changing the address of the DrivingApp Service. This configuration is updated by modifying the smartService variable in the default.py file located in the controllers folder of the application. Example:

> smartService = T('http://0.0.0.0:4005')

#### Manual of the administration app of DrivingApp

The following manual describes the functions of each view of the SimpleAdmin application, for the administration of the DrivingApp system.

#### Map Tools in SimpleAdmin App 

The tools of the maps in the administration application are the following:

- **Map in full screen**: this functionality allows you to see the map to the size of the screen. Activate this option by pressing the box button on the map tools. To exit full screen you can use the Esc key on your keyboard or the same box button of the map tools.
- **Satellite View**: this functionality allows you to see the map in satellite view. You can activate this option by selecting the SateliteMap option in the upper right part of the map.
- **Streets View**: this functionality allows you to see the map with streets view. You can activate this option by selecting the StreetsMap option at the upper right part of the map. This option is selected by default on the map.
- **Zoom**: the + and - tools allow you to zoom in or zoom out the map area as needed.
- **Drawing tools**: Among the drawing tools are, the tool to delimit a new area, polygon; the tool to delimit street segments, polyline; and the tool to eliminate the marked area, the trash can. The edit tool is disabled in this version of the system.

#### Zones administration in the system

The administration of zones in the system consists of two views: the list of zones and the registration of new zones.

#### List of zones

The view of list of zones presents the relevant information of each zone registered in the application, such as: name, address and description. In addition, each zone record contains a button to remove that record from the list; this record is eliminated logically in the system. In the upper right part of the list, the view shows the **Add new zone** button, which is used to go to the Zone Registration view and create new zones in the system. The following image shows an example of this view.

![Lista de Zonas](./img/zonesList.png)

#### Zones Registration

The zone registration view shows a form for the creation of new zones, in this form you must register the data of the zone as: the name, the address and a description of the zone. It is important that the address of the area is a real address. When you type the address of the area in the text field, press the **Search Address on Map** button to search the address of the area on the map. This search is done using a Google Maps API, centering the map center on the direction of the area. Finally, you must define the area of the zone on the map with the  polygon tool. When you have registered the zone data and marked its delimitation on the map, press the **Save** button to register the new zone in the system.
The following image shows an example of this view.

### Administración de bases de datos 

DrivingApp data is managed by three database management systems: MariaDB, Mongo DB and CrateDB. The following image shows a relational diagram of the entities.

The entities stored in MariaDB are shown in the diagram in yellow, the database of these entities is called smartsdksecurity. The entities stored in MongoDB are shown in the diagram in green, the database of these entities is managed by the Orion ContextBroker to store the context information of every entity. The entities stored in CrateDB contains the historical data of the entities managed by the Orion ContextBroker, these entities are shown in the diagram in red color.

![Modelo Relacional de Base de datos](./img/relationalModelDB.png)

Tables of the smartsecurity database in MariaDB

- zone: The table zone is based on the [Building]( https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/tree/master/specs/Building/Building) data model of FIWARE. This model is used in SmartSecurity application to define the area of a organization or institution. 
- offStreetParking: The table offStreetParking is based on the [OffStreetParking](https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/tree/master/specs/Parking/OffStreetParking) data model of FIWARE. This model is used to define the parking lots in the zone of a organization.
- road: The table road is based on the [Road]( https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/tree/master/specs/Transportation/Road) data model of FIWARE.  This model is used in the SmartSecurity application to define roads of the parking lots of a organization; and is also used to define the roads within of the zone of the organization using the responsible attribute.
- roadSegment: The table roadSegment is based on the [RoadSegment]( https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/tree/master/specs/Transportation/RoadSegment) data model of FIWARE. This model is used in the Smart Security application to describe the characteristics of the segments in which is divided a road. In addition, this model provides attributes to detail the properties of the road lanes. 
- mobileUser: The table mobileUser is based on the User data model design for the smart security scenario. This model fulfill with basic attributes used for the authentication service of FIWARE, the Identity Manager - Keyrock. 
- deviceToken: The table deviceToken is based on the DeviceToken data model, design it for complete the devices information represented in the Device data model of FIWARE. The DeviceToken model includes attributtes for the sending and administration of push notifications in the mobile app. 

Context entities from the Orion ContextBroker stored in MongoDB 

- Device: The entities Device are based on the [Device]( https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/blob/master/specs/Device/Device/) of FIWARE
- Alert: The Alert entities are based in the [Alert]( https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/blob/master/specs/Alert/) of FIWARE.

Tables of the time series databse in CrateDB  

- etDevice: The table etDevice is based on the [Device]( https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/blob/master/specs/Device/Device/) data model of FIWARE. 
- etAlert: The table etAlert is based on the [Alert](https://github.com/Fiware/dataModels/blob/master/specs/Alert/) data model of FIWARE.  

The QuantumLeap API converts the Device entities of the Orion in relational records, to store them in the CrateDB database. For more info visit this [section]( https://smartsdk.github.io/ngsi-timeseries-api/user/#data-insertion) in the official documentation of QuantumLeap.
